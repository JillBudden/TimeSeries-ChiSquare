# TimeSeries_ChiSquare
An analysis of data comparing two states (state A & B). One state has a remediation program for nurses that were reported to the board of nursing for a practice-related issue, the other does not. To examine the effects of a remediation program chi-square and time-series analyses were used to examine the following:
a) Proportion of nurses that had their licensure lapse in each state;
b) Time to licensure lapse in each state;
c) Proportion of nurses that recidivated in each state;
d) Time to recidivism in each state.
*Sorry about the long variable names!*
